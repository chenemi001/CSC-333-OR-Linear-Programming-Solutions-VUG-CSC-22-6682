Linear Programming Problems

This repository contains solutions to linear programming (LP) problems aimed at optimizing objectives like profit maximization or cost minimization under specific constraints. The assignments demonstrate practical applications of LP across various scenarios, such as resource allocation, production planning, and cost optimization.



CONTENTS

1. Problem Descriptions
Each problem is carefully defined with:  
- Objective: Maximize or minimize the given objective (e.g., profit, revenue, or cost).  
- Constraints: Real-world limitations (e.g., labor hours, material availability, or budget).  
- Decision Variables: Variables representing quantities to determine (e.g., number of products, trips, or hours).  

2. Problem Scenarios  
This repository includes:  
A. Maximizing Profit for a Factory : A factory produces two products with constraints on machine time and raw materials.  

B. Minimizing Production Costs for a Manufacturer : Two products with different labor and material requirements aim to minimize total costs.  

C. Resource Allocation for Projects: Projects with varying labor and capital requirements focus on maximizing profits.  

D. Maximizing Revenue from Sales:  Sales of products under budget and capacity limitations to maximize revenue.  

E. Transport Optimization: Two vehicle types with fuel and driver time constraints to minimize total transportation cost.  

F. Production Planning for Multiple Products: Optimize labor, raw material, and machine time usage for maximizing revenue.  



3. Features 
- Mathematical Formulation:
  - Objective function and constraints are modeled mathematically.  
  - Decision variables are clearly defined.  

- Graphical Solutions:  
  - Constraints are plotted to identify feasible regions.  
  - Objective function lines are visualized to determine optimal solutions.  

- Interpretation: Solutions are explained in terms of the problem context (e.g., "Produce 5 units of Product P1 and 3 units of Product P2 for maximum revenue").
